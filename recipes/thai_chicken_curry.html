    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One skillet curry based on Thai red curry paste.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 to 3 tbsp coconut oil (olive oil may be substituted)</li>
        <li>1 medium/large sweet Vidalia or yellow onion, diced small</li>
        <li>1 lb boneless skinless chicken breast, diced into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, finely minced or pressed</li>
        <li>2 to 3 teaspoons ground ginger or 1 tablespoon fresh ginger, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground</li>
        <li>one 13-ounce can coconut milk (I used lite; full-fat will deliver a richer/thicker result)</li>
        <li>1 to 1 1/2 cups shredded carrots</li>
        <li>1 to 3 tablespoons Thai red curry paste, or to taste (curry powder may be substituted, to taste)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>about 3 cups fresh spinach leaves</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lime juice</li>
        <li>1 to 2 tablespoons brown sugar, optional and to taste</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh cilantro, finely chopped for garnishing (basil may be substituted</li>
        <li>rice, quinoa, or naan, optional for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To a large skillet, add the oil, onion, and saut√© over medium-high heat until the onion begins to soften about 5 minutes; stir intermittently.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken and cook for about 5 minutes, or until chicken is done; flip and stir often to ensure even cooking.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic, ginger, coriander, and cook for about 1 minute, or until fragrant; stir frequently.</li>
        <li>Add the coconut milk, carrots, Thai curry paste, salt, pepper, and stir to combine. Reduce the heat to medium, and allow mixture to gently boil for about 5 minutes, or until liquid volume has reduced as much as desired and thickens slightly.</li>
        <li>Add the spinach, lime juice, and stir to combine. Cook until spinach has wilted and is tender, about 1 to 2 minutes. Taste and optionally add brown sugar, additional curry paste, salt, pepper, etc. to taste.</li>
        <li>Evenly sprinkle with the cilantro and serve immediately. Curry is best warm and fresh but will keep airtight in the fridge for up to 1 week.</li>
    </ol>
